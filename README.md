Match 3 games are a sub-genre of puzzle games that have become incredibly popular in recent years. The goal of the game is to match at least three identical objects on a game board that consists of tiles, in order to clear them and score points. The gameplay is simple, yet addictive, which is why many people enjoy playing Match 3 games during their free time.

Some of the most popular modern variations of Match 3 games include Candy Crush and Bejeweled. These games have amassed millions of fans all around the world, and they have even inspired other developers to create their own Match 3 games with unique twists and themes.

When it comes to developing Match 3 games, Unity is a great tool to use. Unity is a powerful game engine that provides a robust set of tools and features for game development, and it's particularly well-suited to developing puzzle games like Match 3. With Unity, developers can easily create and manipulate game assets, implement gameplay mechanics, and create engaging visual effects.

Moreover, Unity is a great entry point to more complex game development. Developers who start with creating Match 3 games can gradually expand their skills and knowledge to create more advanced games with more intricate gameplay, graphics, and mechanics.

In summary, Match 3 games are simple yet enjoyable puzzle games that have become a beloved pastime for many players. Unity is a great platform to use for creating Match 3 games, and it also provides an opportunity for developers to progress to more complex game development projects.

In this project we cover topics like creating a grid-based game board, using inheritance to create different types of game pieces, and new levels, detecting matches and clearing pieces, and implementing a user interface complete with a score screen.
